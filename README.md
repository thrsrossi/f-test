## GitConnect

This is a service that utilizes the GitHub API to get access to other GitHub users close to you. The goal is for the user to be able to enter their location and get a result of users in that same area and sort them in the order they where last active so they can easily find the most relevant ones. This is a way to connect to other passionate coders near you!

### Environment

The project was initialized and made to run in this environment:<br />
MacOs High Sierra v10.13.6<br />
Google Chrome browser Version 81.0.4044.129<br />
Node v12.16.2

The project has Eslint and prettier configs and a husky with a pre-commit hook to ensure that the linter and style guides are followed. There is a .editorconfig file that can be used for local editor settings. See https://editorconfig.org/ for more info.

### To start project

`git clone https://github.com/thrsrossi/f-test.git`<br />
`cd f-test`<br />
`yarn`<br />
`yarn start`<br />
`git checkout develop`<br />
branch feature branches from develop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
